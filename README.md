🚀 Built and deployed Web-Server-Using-Docker during my DevOps internship at CodeAlpha! 🐳🔥

This project showcases a full-stack containerized system using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and NGINX, orchestrated with Docker Compose for high performance and modularity.

✨ Key Highlights:

⚙️ FastAPI Backend: Created a lightweight note-taking app using Python’s FastAPI, allowing users to store and retrieve notes via REST APIs.

🐘 PostgreSQL Database: Integrated Bitnami’s PostgreSQL image to ensure efficient, secure, and persistent data storage.

⚡ Redis Caching: Used Redis to cache frequently accessed data and enhance response speed while minimizing database load.

🌐 NGINX Reverse Proxy: Set up a custom Alpine-based NGINX server to handle and route incoming web traffic efficiently.

🛡️ Secure & Lightweight Containers: Used Alpine-based images and conducted vulnerability scans for optimized and secure deployment.

📦 Fully Dockerized: Employed Docker Compose for seamless multi-container orchestration and service communication.

💡 This hands-on experience boosted my understanding of container orchestration, service integration, and scalable backend development.

Excited to explore more in containerized architectures and cloud-native apps! 🌐💥
